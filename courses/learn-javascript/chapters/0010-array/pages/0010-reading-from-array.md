Array elements are numbered.
Numbering starts from 0 and not 1.
This **number** of an element is
known as the **index** of that element.

We can access an element by
specifying its index
in square brackets.

<code>
let names = ["Oliver", "Adam", "Eve"];

console.log(names[0]);
console.log(names[1]);
console.log(names[2]);
